# MyGarden

## This is my secrete garden. 

Let's begin with the git commands as the very starting point of building my garden!

1. Create a repo and sync the local with remote:

    There are two ways of creating a repo, one is to create it at Github and then clone it to your local workspace; the other is to create a repo locally and then push it to remote (for example, Github).

    In the first way:

    Creating the repo is simple, no discussion needed. Then Clone it to any local address you like (the code is always provided by Github). 
(The directory you save the cloned repo usually should not have ".git"; the cloned repo itself has git, so, usually you don't want another git outside the repo.)
    Then you can add, commit and push from local to remote.

    if your local branch is called "main", the command to push is:
    git push origin -u main


    In the second way:

frequently used commands:

git add

git add -i

git commit -s -m

git commit --amend

git push origin -u main

git fetch origin

git pull

git stash

git checkout <filename>

git checkout -b
